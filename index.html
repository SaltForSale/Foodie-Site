            <li>Coarse sea salt</li>

          <h1>Directions</h1>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a large bowl, mix the yeast with 1/2 cup of the warm water and
              the sugar. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the
              remaining 1 1/2 cups of warm water, flour, and kosher salt and
              stir until dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured
              work surface and knead, adding flour as necessary until a silky
              and soft dough forms. Use a pastry scraper to help knead the
              dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and brush all
              over with olive oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
              refrigerate overnight or for up to 3 days.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface; punch down and
              divide into 4 pieces. Form each piece into a ball. Rub each ball
              with oil and transfer to a baking sheet. Cover the balls loosely
              with plastic wrap and let rise in a draft-free place for 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
              Meanwhile, set a pizza stone in the oven and preheat the oven to
              500°F, allowing at least 45 minutes for the stone to heat. Pass
              the tomatoes through a food mill set over a medium bowl or pulse
              them in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Stir in the
              oregano and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and season generously
              with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
              On a lightly floured surface, stretch one ball of dough into a
              13-inch round; transfer to a floured pizza peel, adding flour
              where the dough sticks. Spread 1/4 cup of the tomato sauce over
              the dough to within 1 inch of the edge. Spread one-fourth of the
              cheese over the pizza and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil. Season
              with sea salt and pepper and slide the pizza onto the stone. Bake
              until the bottom is charred and the cheese is melted, about 8
              minutes. Scatter one-fourth of the basil on top and let stand for
              3 minutes before serving. Repeat with the remaining dough and
              toppings.
